and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Planned Features
- Multi-agent workflow implementation
- A2A protocol communication
- Data processing agent with analysis tools
- Report generation agent with multiple output formats
- Configuration management system
- Comprehensive testing suite
- Docker containerization
- CI/CD pipeline

## [0.1.0] - 2024-12-26

### Added
- Initial project structure with `uv` package manager
- Basic CLI interface using Click and Rich libraries
- Strands Agents framework integration
- Hello world functionality for testing setup
- Comprehensive documentation structure
- Development environment configuration

### Project Structure
- Created modular package structure with separate directories for agents, tools, and tests
- Set up proper Python packaging with `pyproject.toml`
- Established CLI entry points for future multi-agent commands

### Documentation
- **README.md**: Comprehensive project overview with architecture and usage examples
- **DEVELOPMENT.md**: Detailed development guide with technical implementation details
- **ARCHITECTURE.md**: System architecture documentation with diagrams and design patterns
- **.env.example**: Complete environment configuration template
- **CHANGELOG.md**: This changelog file for tracking project evolution

### Dependencies
- `strands-agents>=0.1.0`: Core multi-agent framework
- `strands-agents-tools>=0.1.0`: Pre-built tools and utilities
- `click>=8.0.0`: Command-line interface framework
- `rich>=13.0.0`: Rich text and beautiful formatting for terminal output

### CLI Commands
- `multiagent hello`: Welcome message with project information
- `multiagent status`: System status and readiness check
- `multiagent --help`: Command help and usage information

### Development Setup
- Configured for Python 3.12+ with modern tooling
- Set up with `uv` for fast dependency management
- Prepared structure for testing, linting, and formatting tools

### Architecture Decisions
- **Strands Agents Framework**: Chosen for A2A protocol support and AWS integration
- **A2A Protocol**: Standardized agent communication over HTTP
- **Modular Design**: Separate agents for orchestration, data processing, and reporting
- **Configuration-Driven**: Environment-based configuration for different deployment scenarios

### Future Roadmap
- **Phase 2**: Core agent implementation with A2A communication
- **Phase 3**: Advanced features including error handling and monitoring
- **Phase 4**: Production readiness with testing, containerization, and deployment

### Technical Notes
- Project uses semantic versioning
- All agents will communicate via A2A protocol on separate ports (9000-9002)
- Support planned for multiple LLM providers (Bedrock, OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama)
- Designed for horizontal scalability and fault tolerance

### Development Context
This initial release establishes the foundation for a production-ready multi-agent system. The architecture supports:
- Scalable agent communication patterns
- Multiple LLM provider integration
- Comprehensive configuration management
- Professional CLI interface
- Extensive documentation for future development

The project is ready for the next phase of development where the actual multi-agent functionality will be implemented.
